Usage
=====

The following workflow will attempt to illustrate the typical usage of the smart city stack.

#. Consider that two devices have registered with the middleware viz. "streetlight" and "app". 
   The API keys obtained are as follows:
   
   For the streetlight

   .. code-block:: JSON

    {
      "Registration": "success",
      "entityID": "streetlight",
      "apiKey": "ReiHIzTA6hQRbv3JO2gRHP9iEh4NzK-bBSl-J0GKJZo",
      "subscriptionEndPoint": "https://smartcity.rbccps.org/api/{version}/follow?id=streetlight",
      "accessEndPoint": "https://smartcity.rbccps.org/api/{version}/db?id=streetlight",
      "publicationEndPoint": "https://smartcity.rbccps.org/api/{version}/publish?id=streetlight",
      "resourceAPIInfo": "https://rbccps-iisc.github.io"
    }

   For the app

   .. code-block:: JSON
 
    {
      "Registration": "success",
      "entityID": "app",
      "apiKey": "7KfqcDOPvz3JECUwwGsQYuTdKtyGTQTpLDaZjIbJpMt",
      "subscriptionEndPoint": "https://smartcity.rbccps.org/api/{version}/follow?id=app",
      "accessEndPoint": "https://smartcity.rbccps.org/api/{version}/db?id=app",
      "publicationEndPoint": "https://smartcity.rbccps.org/api/{version}/publish?id=app",
      "resourceAPIInfo": "https://rbccps-iisc.github.io"
    }

#. Now let's say that the device ``app`` is interested in ``streetlight`` 's data. It should make a 
   ``follow`` request to ``streetlight`` as below::

    curl -X POST \
    https://localhost:8443/api/1.0.0/follow \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'apikey: 7KfqcDOPvz3JECUwwGsQYuTdKtyGTQTpLDaZjIbJpMt' \
    -d '{
          "entityID": "streetlight",
          "permission":"read", 
          "validity": "10D",
          "requestorID":"app"
        }'

   Note that the API key used to make the follow request is that of ``app`` 's. Once the request goes through, we get
   the success response as

   .. code-block:: JSON

    {"status":"Follow request has been made to streetlight.follow with permission read at 2018-09-10T17:15:23.330Z"} 

#. The device ``streetlight`` would have got a notification in its ``streetlight.follow`` queue. It will subscribe using::

    curl -X GET \
    https://localhost:8443/api/1.0.0/subscribe/streetlight.follow/1 \
    -H 'apikey: ReiHIzTA6hQRbv3JO2gRHP9iEh4NzK-bBSl-J0GKJZo' 

   Note that the API key used is that of ``streetlight``'s. This gives back a response as:

   .. code-block:: JSON

    [
      {
        "data": {
            "permission": "read",
            "validity": "10D",
            "requestor": "app",
            "timestamp": "2018-09-10T17:15:23.311Z"
            },
        "topic": "#",
        "from": "streetlight.follow"
      }
    ]

#. Now that the device ``streetlight`` knows that the device ``app`` is interested in its data, it can approve the ``follow`` 
   by calling the ``share``::

    curl -X POST \
    https://localhost:8443/api/1.0.0/share \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'apikey: ReiHIzTA6hQRbv3JO2gRHP9iEh4NzK-bBSl-J0GKJZo' \
    -d '{
           "entityID": "streetlight",
           "permission":"read", 
           "validity": "10D",
           "requestorID":"app"
        }'
   
   Note that the API key used to call the share is that of ``streetlight``'s. The above request would give back a response as

   .. code-block:: JSON

    {"status":"Share request approved for app with permission read at 2018-09-10T17:26:50.908Z"}

#. The issuance of ``share`` by the ``streetlight`` sends out a notification to the ``app.notify`` queue. The ``app`` device can retrieve
   the status using::

    curl -X GET \
    https://localhost:8443/api/1.0.0/subscribe/app.notify/1 \
    -H 'apikey: 7KfqcDOPvz3JECUwwGsQYuTdKtyGTQTpLDaZjIbJpMt'

   The API key used is that of ``app``'s. This would give out a response as
   
   .. code-block:: JSON

    [
      {
        "data": 
            {
              "Status update for follow request sent to streetlight": "Approved. You can now bind to streetlight.protected"
            },
        "topic": "#",
        "from": "app.notify"
      }
    ]

#. Now that the device ``app`` has undertsood that ``stretlight`` has approved the request for read, it can now bind its queue
   to ``streetlight.protected`` using::

    curl -X GET \
    https://localhost:8443/api/1.0.0/bind/app/streetlight.protected \
    -H 'apikey: 7KfqcDOPvz3JECUwwGsQYuTdKtyGTQTpLDaZjIbJpMt' \
    -H 'routingKey: #'

   Note that the API used is that of ``app``'s. This above request would give out a success message as::
  
    Bind Queue OK

#. Now if ``streetlight`` publishes any data using its API key::

    curl -X POST \
    https://localhost:8443/api/1.0.0/publish/streetlight.protected \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'apikey: ReiHIzTA6hQRbv3JO2gRHP9iEh4NzK-bBSl-J0GKJZo' \
    -H 'routingKey: #' \
    -d '{
	 "ambientLux": "10",
	 "caseTemp": 34.5
        }'

  The device ``app`` can also get a copy of the data in its queue by using::

   curl -X GET \
   https://localhost:8443/api/1.0.0/subscribe/app/1 \
   -H 'apikey: 7KfqcDOPvz3JECUwwGsQYuTdKtyGTQTpLDaZjIbJpMt'

  Note the use of ``app``'s API key to subscribe. This would give a response as

  .. code-block:: JSON

   [
    {
      "data": 
        {
          "ambientLux": "10",
          "caseTemp": 34.5
        },
      "topic": "#",
      "from": "streetlight.protected"
    }
   ]

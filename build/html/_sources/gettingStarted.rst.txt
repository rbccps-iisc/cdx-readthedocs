Getting Started
===============

This guide will help you to quickly get started with a single node instance of CDX and start publishing data from a device.

Installation
------------
* Clone the project using ``git clone https://github.com/rbccps-iisc/ideam && cd ideam``
* Run ``./install``

Registering your first device
-----------------------------

* Once CDX has installed you can now start registering devices with it. Let's create a simple test device for the sake of illustration.
    ``sh tests/create_entity.sh testStreetlight``
* This will give you the details of the registration
